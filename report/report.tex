\section{Behavioral Effects in Magnitude Estimation}
Magnitude estimation is subject to noise that arises from external sources i.e. the statistics of the environment and internal sources i.e. neural representation of the input and the behavior.
Across sensory modalities, characteristic behavioral effects are identified (\cite{Petzschner2015}).
The most prominent observation is a regression to the mean of the stimulus range,  i.e. small stimuli are overestimated whereas large stimuli are underestimated (\textit{regression effect}). 
This effect intensifies for ranges with larger stimuli (\textit{range effect})
For larger stimuli the standard deviation of estimates increases monotonically (\textit{scalar variability}). 
Finally, the recent history of stimuli presentations influences the current stimuli estimation (\textit{sequential effect}).
All effects mentioned above are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:behavioraleffects}. 

Modality-independence of these effects suggests the existence of a common underlying principle or processing mechanisms, that would explain e.g. a optimal strategy for unreliable judgments due to noise (in stimuli and estimates).

\section{Model Description}
Neural activity yields characteristic trajectories during time perception and time reproduction (\cite{Meirhaeghe2021}, \cite{Wang2018}, \cite{Henke2021}). 
Flexible motor timing can be achieved by controlling the speed of neural dynamics (\cite{Sohn2019}, \cite{Wang2018}). 
Further, it has been found that neural activity in anticipation of a delayed response reaches a fixed threshold with rate inversely proportional to delay period \cite{Murakami2014}, \cite{Mita2009}).
\cite{Wang2018} proposed a potential neural mechanism for speed control and based on that \cite{Egger2020} developed a neural circuit model for sensorimotor timing.

\subsection{Circuit}
Flexible speed control can be achieved by a simple model consisting of three units, u, v, y that represent population activity. Two units, u and v receive symmetric input I and have symmetric mutual inhibitory projections onto each other. The input to u and v is governed by a sigmoidal activation function $\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-x)}$ and all three units have a time constant $\tau$. 
The output unit y receives excitatory input from u and inhibitory input from v and shows ramp-like behavior. 
Speed at which the output y evolves can be controlled by the shared input to u and v.(\cite{Egger2020})

Depending on the input I, the system shows different dynamics. For low levels of I (0$<$I$<$0.5) the system has three fixed points (2 stable, 1 unstable at u=v) and y ramps up faster the higher the input I. 
For intermediate values of I (0.5$<$I$<$1) the system still shows three FP of the same sort and y ramps up, however the relation of slope and input level is inverted (y ramps up slower the higher the input I). 
For high I (1$<$I) the system has one stable fixed point (at u=v) and y ramps down with a slope that is inversely proportional to the input I ()
In this report, the intermediate input regime is explored (Fig. \ref{fig:circuit}b)

\begin{align} \label{circuit}
\tau\frac{du}{dt} & = -u + \theta(W_{uI}I - W_{uv}v + \eta_u) \\
\tau\frac{dv}{dt} & = -v + \theta(W_{vI}I - W_{vu}v + \eta_v) \\
\tau\frac{dy}{dt} & = -y + W_{yu}u - W_{yv}v + \eta_y
\end{align}
