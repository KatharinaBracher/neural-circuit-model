abstract = {The abnormal origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk is currently one of the most significant coronary anomalies that is not associated with diffuse atherosclerotic involvement. Because of the lack of specific symptoms, it is often the outcome of casual observation during heart surgery or autopsy. At times, the patients die of congestive heart failure or sudden death without even having had this anomaly diagnosed. We describe the case of a 41-year-old woman who came under our observation due to palpitations, both at rest and under stress, that were also associated with chest pain at times. Clinical and instrumental investigation revealed that abnormal origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk, indicating that the symptoms were probably caused by intracoronary or intercoronary 'stealing'. The primary treatment of this pathology is based on surgical techniques, and it is constituted by the simple ligation of the anomalous vessel or the ligation of the right coronary artery, with saphenous vein by-pass grafting or the reimplantation of the right coronary artery into the aorta. We opted for reimplantation of the anomalous vessel into the aorta: a three-year follow-up has shown very good results, with complete disappearance of the symptoms.},

abstract = {A cornerstone of statistical inference, the maximum entropy framework is being increasingly applied to construct descriptive and predictive models of biological systems, especially complex biological networks, from large experimental data sets. Both its broad applicability and the success it obtained in different contexts hinge upon its conceptual simplicity and mathematical soundness. Here we try to concisely review the basic elements of the maximum entropy principle, starting from the notion of ‘entropy', and describe its usefulness for the analysis of biological systems. As examples, we focus specifically on the problem of reconstructing gene interaction networks from expression data and on recent work attempting to expand our system-level understanding of bacterial metabolism. Finally, we highlight some extensions and potential limitations of the maximum entropy approach, and point to more recent developments that are likely to play a key role in the upcoming challenges of extracting structures and information from increasingly rich, high-throughput biological data.},

abstract = {Hippocampal area CA2 has several features that distinguish it from CA1 and CA3, including a unique gene expression profile, failure to display long-term potentiation and relative resistance to cell death. A recent increase in interest in the CA2 region, combined with the development of new methods to define and manipulate its neurons, has led to some exciting new discoveries on the properties of CA2 neurons and their role in behaviour. Here, we review these findings and call attention to the idea that the definition of area CA2 ought to be revised in light of gene expression data.},

@article{Magee2001,
abstract = {Dual whole-cell patch clamp recordings from the soma and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons located in hippocampal slices of adult rats were used to examine the potential mechanisms of phase precession. To mimic phasic synaptic input, 5-Hz sine wave current injections were simultaneously delivered both to the soma and apical dendrites (dendritic current was 180° out-of-phase with soma). Increasing the amplitude of the dendritic current injection caused somatic action potential initiation to advance in time (move forward up to 180°). The exact pattern of phase advancement is dependent on the dendritic location of input, with more distal input causing a more gradual temporal shift in spike initiation and a smaller increase in spike number. Patterned stimulation of Schaffer collateral/perforant path synaptic input can produce phase precession that is very similar to that observed with sine wave current injections. Finally, the exact amount of synaptic input required to produce phase advancement was found to be regulated by dendritic voltage-gated ion channels. Together, these data demonstrate that the summation of primarily proximal inhibition with an increasing amount of out-of-phase, primarily distal excitation can result in a form of phase advancement similar to that seen during theta activity in the intact hippocampus.},

@article{Welzel2019,
abstract = {During the last decades it became increasingly evident that electrical synapses are capable of activity-dependent plasticity. However, measuring the actual strength of electrical transmission remains difficult. Usually changes in coupling strength can only be inferred indirectly from measures such as the coupling coefficient and the coupling conductance. Because these are affected by both junctional and non-junctional conductance, plastic changes can potentially be due to both components. Furthermore, these techniques also require the blocking of chemical transmission, so that processes that involve crosstalk between chemical and electrical synapses will be suppressed. To directly examine the magnitude of errors that can occur, we use dual whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings from the soma of the pair of easily accessible, electrically coupled Retzius cells in the leech to simultaneously determine coupling coefficients, coupling conductances and directly measured gap junctional currents. We present the first direct and comparative analysis of gap junction conductance using all three methods and analyze how each method would characterize the response of gap junctions to serotonin. The traditional coupling coefficients showed severe deficits in assessing the symmetry and strength of electrical synapses. These were reduced when coupling conductances were determined and were absent in the direct method. Additionally, both coupling coefficient and coupling conductance caused large and systematic errors in assessing the size and time course of the serotonin-induced changes of gap junctional currents. Most importantly, both measurements can easily be misinterpreted as implying long-term gap junctional plasticity, although the direct measurements confirm its absence. We thus show directly that coupling coefficients and coupling conductances can severely confound plastic changes in membrane and junctional conductance. Wherever possible, voltage clamp measurements should be chosen to accurately characterize the timing and strength of plasticity of electrical synapses. However, we also demonstrate that coupling coefficients can still yield a qualitatively correct picture when amended by independent measurements of the course of membrane resistance during the experiments.},

@article{Rowan2016,
abstract = {In axons, an action potential (AP) is thought to be broadcast as an unwavering binary pulse over its arbor, driving neurotransmission uniformly at release sites. Yet by recording from axons of cerebellar stellate cell (SC) interneurons, we show that AP width varies between presynaptic bouton sites, even within the same axon branch. The varicose geometry of SC boutons alone does not impose differences in spike duration. Rather, axonal patching revealed heterogeneous peak conductance densities of currents mediated mainly by fast-activating Kv3-type potassium channels, with clustered hotspots at boutons and restricted expression at adjoining shafts. Blockade of Kv channels at individual boutons indicates that currents immediately local to a release site direct spike repolarization at that location. Thus, the clustered arrangement and variable expression density of Kv3 channels at boutons are key determinants underlying compartmentalized control of AP width in a near synapse-by-synapse manner, multiplying the signaling capacity of these structures.},

@article{Aggleton2010,
abstract = {This review charts recent advances from a variety of disciplines that create a new perspective on why the multiple hippocampal-anterior thalamic interconnections are together vital for human episodic memory and rodent event memory. Evidence has emerged for the existence of a series of parallel temporal-diencephalic pathways that function in a reciprocal manner, both directly and indirectly, between the hippocampal formation and the anterior thalamic nuclei. These extended pathways also involve the mammillary bodies, the retrosplenial cortex and parts of the prefrontal cortex. Recent neuropsychological findings reveal the disproportionate importance of these hippocampal-anterior thalamic systems for recollective rather than familiarity-based recognition, while anatomical studies highlight the precise manner in which information streams are kept separate but can also converge at key points within these pathways. These latter findings are developed further by electrophysiological stimulation studies showing how the properties of the direct hippocampal-anterior thalamic projections are often opposed by the indirect hippocampal projections via the mammillary bodies to the thalamus. Just as these hippocampal-anterior thalamic interactions reflect an interdependent system, so it is also the case that pathology in one of the component sites within this system can induce dysfunctional changes to distal sites both directly and indirectly across the system. Such distal effects challenge more traditional views of neuropathology as they reveal how extensive covert pathology might accompany localised overt pathology, and so impair memory. {\textcopyright} 2010 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
