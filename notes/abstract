## Circuit model for scaling effects in timing

[comment]: <>  (purpose and importance of the research)
Magnitude estimation shows characteristic effects that likely result from an optimal strategy to minimize errors of judgments. 
Even though timing ranks among the most fundamental computations of the brain, the mechanism is not well understood. 

[comment]: <>  (previous research, limitations)
Evidence suggests the brain encodes time through scaling neural activity (Meirhaeghe et al. 2021).
Wang et al. 2018 argues that controlling the speed is realized by controlling the input of a dynamical system and proposed a neural circuit to model sensorimotor timing.

[comment]: <>  (methods)
The circuit receives a tonic context-dependent input that is updated based on an error signal before the interval reproduction. 
We used the model to simulate realistic time reproduction experiments.

[comment]: <>  (results, findings)
The model shows parameter ranges that result in typical effects of magnitude estimation and that are in accordance with error minimization across two stimulus ranges.
