## Claim
Scaling in brain data explains behavioral effects
### Qualifier 
how much can the model explain?

## Assumption
scaling activity in population activity is the basis of time measurement/ reproduction 

## Backing
PFC data, neural trajectories 

## Grounds
Experimental data, behavior
Neural circuit model for sensimotor timing
Model that describes the phenomenon of scaling can be fitted to data

## Limitations
model does not represent neural populations
it is a very easy model -> we really know what is going on 
how is the input and threshold implemented the brain?

## Claim
Scaling activity in population activity is the basis of time measurement/ reproduction
## Qualifier

## Assumption
Timing can be measured in PFC

## Backing
PFC data in experiments
connection to motor areas, upstream and downstream areas
timing tasks, differences in epochs

## Grounds
neural trajectories fit, explain


## Limitations
model does not represent neural populations
it is a very easy model, how much can it explain?
